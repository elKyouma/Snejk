# The Genesis
This simple script was created during the really boring classess of powershell. I couldn't stand how unintresting labolatories were so I just simply made a game.

# Set up
1. Get the repo
2. Turn on powershell script executing by changing
  You can use this command as admin: **Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine**,
  idk how safe it id but for me it works
3. Use script with ./snake.ps1

# How to play

You can move the snake by using arrow
